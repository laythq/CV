## Education

#### Makers Academy (June to September 2018)

Through Makers, I have picked up a number of skills and experiences. I have learned some Object Oriented Design fundamentals and applied them in my projects, which have been in [Ruby](https://github.com/laythq/MakersBnB), [Rails](https://github.com/laythq/acebook-nice-team) and [Javascript](https://github.com/laythq/NotesApp). I have learned how to test drive my code comprehensively, through tools and frameworks such as RSpec, Jasmine, Istanbul and others. I now fully appreciate the value of TDD and have applied it in all my work so far. I have also learned some basic Front-End skills, working with HTML, CSS and React, as well as other Back-End skills such as SQL. 

I have also enjoyed the experience of learning more about how the Web works. I have built a number of Web Apps as part of a team as well as individually at Makers, working with Rails, Sinatra and Node/Express in the process. 

#### BA Philosophy (2:1), University of Warwick (October 2011 to May 2014)
