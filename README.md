### Layth Al-Qattan

I am a full-stack junior developer and have just completed a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers in London. I previously spent a year working on some of Kuwait's most prestigious engineering [projects](http://www.alhani.com/), managing various high-performing engineering and contracting teams. Before that, I spent years working around the world in multi-cultural, multi-lingual organisations ranging from banking to education. 

I am looking to keep learning and developing as a coder and would like to join a dynamic and compelling company and surround myself with passionate developers that I can learn from. I love working with others, and writing clean, fully-tested code that my team can rely on.

My favourite projects are:

|Name        |Description|Technologies|
|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
|[Array of Sunshine](https://github.com/laythq/array_of_sunshine)|For our final project, we built a tool for beginner developers which figures out the right methods for array manipulation in JS, Ruby, and Python.|React, Node.js/Express, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, Python, Enzyme, RSpec, Jest, Pytest, Heroku|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/laythq/acebook-nice-team)|A Facebook clone, this group-project can handle user registration, login, posts, comments, and likes. 100% code coverage.|React, Node.js/Express, Rails, Rspec, Travis, Heroku|
|[Database Server](https://github.com/laythq/database-server-tech-test)| A tech test for setting up a simple database server, (but without a database - data is stored in memory). Tests are fully isolated and coverage is 100%.|Node.js/Express, Javascript, Jasmine, Mocha, node-http-mock, mockery, supertest|

### Skills

#### I can deliver to clients

I spent a year in Kuwait working with a number of electrical, civil and mechanical engineers on some of the country's biggest engineering projects. Working with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture and the Royal Court, I served some the country's most high profile clients and helped deliver [huge projects](http://www.alhani.com/) on tight timelines.

#### I can work in a team

Last year, two friends and I turned a side-interest in street-food into viable business by co-founding [The Big Bushi](https://www.instagram.com/thebigbushi/?hl=en), offering London's first Sushi Burrito in Brick Lane. We built the company from scratch and began trading within months of inception. I was personally responsible for developing the product, marketing, trading and logistics. I gained a first-hand perspective on the challenges of starting any new venture and working in a small and dynamic team.

#### I can work under pressure

Having worked as a legal consultant in Egypt, an events coordinater in London, an investment banking intern in Dubai and a graduate at a contracting business in Kuwait, I enjoy working under pressure and adapting to meet the needs of my work, especially when working in unfamiliar environments where I have had to learn things quickly. 

### What I love about coding

#### Languages and Frameworks

The projects I've worked on at Makers have exposed me to a range of different languages and frameworks. I love the flexibility of Javascript, especially the different libraries it can be used with. The ability to make a fully dynamic, single-page [app](https://github.com/laythq/array_of_sunshine) in React was one of my proudest moments at Makers, and made me appreciate the power of the library and JS in general. 

Making a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/laythq/acebook-nice-team) using Rails was another great experience that I learned a huge amount from. Rails was the first framework I'd come across during the course, and I love its versatility. Although I didn't always understand what was going on 'under the hood', and had to adjust to the framework's strong opinions, it was a pleasure to work with and really helped me understand the power of such frameworks.

#### OOD, TDD, BDD and other habits

I enjoy the challenges that come with writing good code, especially testing and integration. I've picked up a number of useful habits over my learning journey, not least an obsession with test-driving my code, whether its unit testing or feature testing. I've used RSpec, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Pytest, Cypress and other suites.

I've also learned valuable ways of approaching design problems, whether it's drawing a simple diagram or writing out a few user stories. I've learned that understanding the end-goal and getting a macro view of the problem is essential before diving in.

#### Collaboration

I love the collaborative nature of software development. Solving a stubborn little bug with a pair partner over a couple of hours, or building and deploying a full application over a couple of weeks, I really enjoy building things with others and want to continue doing so. 

I have had the opportunity to work on three different projects in different teams, including a two-week [final project](https://github.com/laythq/array_of_sunshine), and have been pair programming throughout the whole course with the rest of my cohort. All three group projects were built using Agile methodologies, building out a product iteratively (starting with an MVP) and communicating as a team through a series of stand-ups and retros. I now appreciate the effectiveness of Agile and how it can really unlock a team's potential and productivity.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June to September 2018)

Through Makers, I have picked up a number of skills and experiences. I have learned some Object Oriented Design fundamentals and applied them in my projects, which have been in [Ruby](https://github.com/laythq/MakersBnB), [Rails](https://github.com/laythq/acebook-nice-team) and [Javascript](https://github.com/laythq/NotesApp). I have learned how to test drive my code comprehensively, through tools and frameworks such as RSpec, Jasmine, Istanbul and others. I now fully appreciate the value of TDD and have applied it in all my work so far. I have also learned some basic Front-End skills, working with HTML, CSS and React, as well as other Back-End skills such as SQL. 

I have also enjoyed the experience of learning more about how the Web works. I have built a number of Web Apps as part of a team as well as individually at Makers, working with Rails, Sinatra and Node/Express in the process. 

#### BA Philosophy (2:1), University of Warwick (October 2011 to May 2014)

Modules include: Logic, Philosophy of Science, Elements of the Scientific Method and Critical Security Studies.

#### Chartered Financial Analyst Level 1
