### Layth Al-Qattan

I am a full-stack junior developer and have just completed a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers in London. I am looking to keep learning and developing as a coder and would like to join a dynamic and compelling company and surround myself with passionate developers that I can learn from. My absolute priority is to continue developing my technical ability and to start contributing to a professional dev team. I love working with others, and writing clean, fully-tested code that my team can rely on. 

My favourite projects are:

## Skills

#### I love working in a team

At Makers I have had the opportunity to work on three different projects in different teams, including a two-week [final project](https://github.com/laythq/array_of_sunshine), and have been pair programming throughout the whole course with the rest of my cohort. I've found the experience to be extremely enjoyable, and firmly believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. 

Before Makers, two friends and I turned a side-interest in street-food into viable business by co-founding The Big Bushi, offering London's first Sushi Burrito in Brick Lane. We built the company from scratch and began trading within months of inception. I was personally responsible for developing the product, marketing, trading and logistics. I gained a first-hand perspective on the challenges of starting any new venture and working in a small and dynamic team.

#### I am curious and passionate about code

I spent a year working with a number of electrical, civil and mechanical engineers, and admired the precision and scientific nature of their work. And when I started exploring software development as a hobby, I found my first few CodeWars challenges extremely rewarding, and felt drawn towards this field. The feeling of solving a technical challenge is addictive, and my desire to continue doing so full-time has only strengthened during my Makers course. 

In my own time I enjoy reading about wider developments in the industry. I have a keen interest in the business and entrepreneurial side of different companies, and love to read about major fundraising and deals that occur across the world in the industry. My favourite publications are TechCrunch, Medium and the Financial Times.

#### I can learn quickly and independently

The Makers Academy course is structured around independent and self-directed learning in a high pace environment. As well as a strong emphasis on team work and pairing, students are also taught how to pick up skills through their own research and individual weekend projects. This course has given me the confidence to continue doing so. 

Having worked as a legal consultant in Egypt, an events coordinater in London, an investment banking intern in Dubai and a graduate at a contracting business in Kuwait, I enjoy working under pressure and adapting to meet the needs of my work, especially when working in unfamiliar environments where I have had to learn things quickly. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June to September 2018)

Through Makers, I have picked up a number of skills and experiences. I have learned some Object Oriented Design fundamentals and applied them in my projects, which have been in [Ruby](https://github.com/laythq/MakersBnB), [Rails](https://github.com/laythq/acebook-nice-team) and [Javascript](https://github.com/laythq/NotesApp). I have learned how to test drive my code comprehensively, through tools and frameworks such as RSpec, Jasmine, Istanbul and others. I now fully appreciate the value of TDD and have applied it in all my work so far. I have also learned some basic Front-End skills, working with HTML, CSS and React, as well as other Back-End skills such as SQL. 

I have also enjoyed the experience of learning more about how the Web works. I have built a number of Web Apps as part of a team as well as individually at Makers, working with Rails, Sinatra and Node/Express in the process. 

#### BA Philosophy (2:1), University of Warwick (October 2011 to May 2014)

Modules include: Logic, Philosophy of Science, Elements of the Scientific Method and Critical Security Studies.

#### Chartered Financial Analyst Level 1
