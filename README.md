## Layth Al-Qattan

I am an ambitious and entrepreneurial self-starter who loves to code and learn. My work experience is very diverse, ranging from banking and contracting, to teaching. I have a very strong work ethic and enjoy fast and self-directed learning.

I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle-East, and have been able to work and prosper in unfamiliar cultures and organisations. I have direct experience of founding and leading independent ventures such as the University of Warwick Arabic Society, the People & Politics talks series, and a street-food startup in Brick Lane.

Having just completed a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers in London, I am looking to keep learning and developing as a coder. I would like to join a dynamic and compelling company and surround myself with passionate developers that I can learn from. My absolute priority is to continue developing my technical ability and to start contributing to a professional team. 

## Skills

Over the Summmer, through Makers, I have been exposed to a very wide range of software development concepts, languages and frameworks. I have had the opportunity to work on three different projects in different teams, including a two-week final project, and have been pair programming throughout the whole course with the rest of my cohort.

# Learning

Throughout my career so far, I have often been put in extremely unfamiliar business environments that have forced me to learn and adapt at a very fast pace. I enjoy applying myself and learn the skills needed to prosper in any working environment I find myself in. I am personally a very curious and passionate person who enjoys learning independently and being exposed to new and unfamiliar ideas.

# I love working in a team

Two friends and I turned a side-interest in street-food into viable business by co-founding The Big Bushi, offering London's first Sushi Burrito in Brick Lane. We built the company from scratch and began trading within months of inception. I was personally responsible for developing the product, marketing, trading and logistics. I gained a first-hand perspective on the challenges of starting any new venture and working in a small and dynamic team.

I have started a number of different team projects from scratch, starting in University. Launching a cultural society with friends across one of the biggest campuses in the UK was an incredibly enjoyable experience. My friends and I quickly established the organisation as a cultural hub on campus, launching the Warwick Middle-East North Africa Forum shortly after.

Other such experiences include launching a political talks series around the May 2015 UK General Election, centred around a series of talks and debates with a live audience at a space in West London. I was responsible for directing the series as a whole, marketing, logistics and presenting. 

#### I am curious and passionate about code

Before I enrolled in Makers Academy in April of this year, I had absolutely no experience in software development and coding. Since then, my interest and engagement with the subject has grown exponentially, and I am completely fascinated by the subject. I have taken the opportunities given to me in this course to push my technical abilities constantly and to continue learning.

#### I can learn quickly and independently
