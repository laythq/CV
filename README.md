## Layth Al-Qattan

I am an ambitious and entrepreneurial self-starter who is awed by the power and potential of clean code. A strong academic track record, achieving the CFA Level 1 certification through independent study, and banking and contracting experience all prove a very strong work ethic and innate ability for fast and self-directed learning.

I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle-East, and demonstrated a strong ability to work and prosper in unfamiliar cultures and organisations. I have direct experience of founding and leading independent ventures such as the University of Warwick Arabic Society, the People & Politics talks series, and a street-food startup in Brick Lane.

What I am looking for....

## Skills

# Learning

Throughout my career so far, I have often been put in extremely unfamiliar business environments that have forced me to learn and adapt at a very fast pace. Having worked as a legal consultant in Egypt, an events coordinater in London, an investment banking intern in Dubai and a graduate at a contracting business in Kuwait, I thrive outside of my comfort zone. I am confident in my ability to apply myself and learn the skills needed to prosper in any working environment I find myself in. I am personally a very curious and passionate person who enjoys learning independently, as I did with my Chartered Financial Analyst Level 1 certification.

# Enterprise

Two friends and I turned a side-interest in street-food into viable business by co-founding The Big Bushi, offering London's first Sushi Burrito in Brick Lane. We built the company from scratch and began trading within months of inception. I was personally responsible for developing the product, marketing, trading and logistics. I gained a first-hand perspective on the challenges of starting any new venture.

I have started a number of different projects from scratch as part of a management team, starting in University. Launching a cultural society with friends across one of the biggest campuses in the UK was an incredibly enjoyable experience. My friends and I quickly established the organisation as a cultural hub on campus, launching the Warwick Middle-East North Africa Forum shortly after.

Other entrepreneurial experiences include launching a political talks series around the May 2015 UK General Election, centred around a series of talks and debates with a live audience at a space in West London. I was responsible for directing the series as a whole, marketing, logistics and presenting.
